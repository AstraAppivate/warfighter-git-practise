The Entire Shrek Script

Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort, which could only be broken by Love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but none prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. Like that's ever going to happen. What a loony. Shrek Beware Stay out I think he's in here. All right. Lets get it! Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? Yeah. He'll groan into your bones for his brains. Well actually that would be a giant. Now Ogres, huh, they are much worse. They'll make a soup from your freshly peeled skin. They'll chew your livers, squeeze the jelly from your eyes. Actually, it's quite good on toast. Back, back beast, back! I warned you! Right. This is the part, where you run away. Yeah! And stay out. Wanted. Fairytale creatures. Right, this one is full. Take it away. Give me that. Your fine days are over. -25 pieces of silver for the witch. Next. -Come on. Sit down there! And be quiet! This cage is so small. You wouldn't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please, give me another chance. Oh, shut up! Next. What do we got? This little wooden puppet. I'm not a puppet, I'm a real boy. Five shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. No! Please, don't let them do it! Next. What do you got? Well, I've got a talking donkey! Right. Well that's good for ten schillings, if you can prove it. Oh, go ahead fella. Well? He's just a li..., just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. You boneheaded donkey! That's it. I have heard enough. Guards! No, no, he talks, he does! I can talk. I love to talk. I've talked to... Get her out of my sight! -No, no, I swear! Hey, I can fly. -He can fly! -He can fly! He can talk! -That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey! You might have seen house fly, maybe even a superfly. But I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly! Seize him! Get him! This way! Hurry! You there. Ogre. -I. By the order of lord Farquaad. I am authorized to place you both under arrest. And transport you to designated resettlement facility. Oh really? You and what army? Can I say something to you? Listen, you were really, really something, back there. Incredible. Are you talking to... ...me? Yes, I was talking to you. Can I just tell you that you were really great back there with those guards. They thought that was all over there. And then you showed up and BAM. There was tripping on over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. Oh, that's great. Really. Man, it's good to be free. Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? But I... I don't have any friends. And I'm not going out there by myself. Hey wait a minute. I have a great idea... I'll stick with you. You and me in green fighting machine. Together we'll scare the spin if anybody crosses us. Oh, a, that was really scary. Maybe you don't mine me saying. If that don't work, your breath will certainly do the job done, 'cause... you definitively need some tic-tac or something, 'cause your breath stinks! Man you've ??? my note! Just like the time... ...and then I ate some rotten berries. Man I had some strong gases leaking out of my but that day. Why are you following me? I'll tell you why. 'Cause I'm all alone, there is no one here, beside me. My problems have all gone. There's no one to derive me. But you got to have free ... -Stop singing! Well, it's no wonder, you don't have any friends. Wow! Only a true friend would be that truly honest. Listen! Little donkey. Take a look at me! What am I? A... ...really tall? No! I'm an Ogre. You know, grab your torch and pitchforks. Doesn't that bother you? Nope. Really? -Really really. Oh? Man, I like you. What's your name? A..., Shrek. Shrek?! But do you know, what I like about you, Shrek? You've got that kind of: "I don't care what nobody thinks of me" thing. I like that, I respect that, Shrek. You're all right. Uh, look at that. Who would wanna live in a place like that? That would be my home. Oh, it is lovely. Just beautiful. You know you're quite a decorator. It's amazing what you did with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess, you don't entertain much, do you? I like my privacy. You know I do to. That's another thing, we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You try to give them a hint and they won't leave. And then there's that big occurred silence, you know? Can I stay with you? -What? Can I stay with you, please. Of course! -Really? No. -Please! I don't want to go back there. You don't how is like to be concerned like a freak. Well..., maybe you do. But that's why we have to stick together! You got to let me stay! Please! Please! OK, OK. -But one night only. -Huh, thank you! A, what are you do... No! This is going to be fun. We can stay up late, swap the manly stories. And in 
the morning... I'm making waffles. Where do I sleep? Outside! Oh, a, I guess that's cool. You know, I don't know you and you don't know me... ... so I guess, outside is best for me. Here I go. Good night. I do like that half door. I'm a donkey all alone outside. Sit by myself outside, I guess. I'm all alone, there's no one here beside me. -I thought, I told you to stay outside. -I am outside. Well James. This is far from the farm, but what choice do we have? It's not... What a lovely bed. -Got you! I found some cheese. Awful stuff. -Is that you Gordon? -How did you know? Enough! What are you doing in my house? Oh, no, no, no... Death prods off the table! Where would we supposed to put her. The bed's taken. What? I live in a swamp. I've put up signs. I'm a terrifying Ogre! What do I have to do, to get a little privacy? Oh, no! No, no! What are you doing in my swamp? All right, get out of here. All of you. Move it! Come on, let's go. And hurry up, hurry up. No, no, not there. Not there! Hey don't look at me. I didn't invite them. Oh gosh, no one invited us. -What? We were forced to come here. -By who? Lord Farquaad. He ??? All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is? Oh I do. I know where he is. Does anyone else know where to find him? -Anyone at all? -Me. -Anyone? Oh pick me, I know! Me, me. Ok, fine. Attention all fairy tale things! Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially warned up. In fact. I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get all off my land and back where you came from. You. You're coming with me. All right. That's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stubborn friends off on a world and big city adventure. I love it. I'm on road again. Sing with me Shrek! I'm on road again... What did I say about singing? -Can I whistle? -No. -Well, can I hummer? -All right. That's enough. He's ready to talk. Run, run, run as fast as you can, you can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. You monster. I'm not a monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairytale trash, poisoning my perfect world. -Now tell me! Where are the others? -Eat me. I've tried to be fair to you, creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! -Tell me! Or I'll... -No, no, not the buttons. Not gumdrop buttons. All right! Who's hiding them? Ok, I'll tell you. -Do you know the muffin-man? -The muffin-man? -The muffin-man. -Yes, I know the muffin-man. Who lives on Proully lane? -Well, she's married to the muffin-man. -The muffin-man! -The muffin-man! -She's married to the muffin-man. My lord! We found it. Well then, what are you waiting for? Bring it in. Magic mirror. Don't tell him anything! Evening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? Well, technically, you're not a king. A..., felonious. -You were saying. -What I mean is a... ...you're not a king, yet. But you can become one. All you have to do, is marry a princess. Go on. So, just sit back and relax my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are. Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shading from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hottubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for two evil sisters. Please welcome... Cinderella. Bachelorette number two is a kemp wearing girl from a land of fantasy. Although she lives with seven other man, she is not easy. Just kiss hers dead frozen lips and find out what a live wife she is. Come on. Give it up for... Show-white. And last but certainly not least. Bachelorette number three is a fire-breathing ????, dragon guarded castle, surrounded by a hot boiling lava. But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes Pina Coladas and getting cut in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona. So will it be, bachelorette number one? Bachelorette number two? Or bachelorette number three? -Two... -Three! -Two! One. No, no, no. Three. Pick number three my lord. Ok, ok. Number three. Lord Farquaad. You've chosen... princess Fiona. She's nice. Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone... But I probably should mention little thing that happens at night... -I'll do it! -Yes, but after sunset... Silence! I will make this princess Fiona my queen. And Duloc will finally have the perfect king! Captain! Assemble your finest man. We're going to have a tournament! That's it, that's, right there, that's Duloc. I've told you I'll find it. So. That must be lord Farquaad's castle. Aha, that's the place. Do you think maybe he's compensating for something. Hey, hey wait up Shrek! -Hey, you! -No, no! Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just... It's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? Hey look at this. Wow! -Let's do that again. -No. no. All right. You're going the right way for smack bottom. Sorry about that. That champion should have the honor, no, no... ...the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely princess Fiona from the fireing keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first 
runner up will take his place. And so on, and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make. Applause. Let the tournament begin. What is that? Ugh, it's hideous. Oh, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. Indeed. Knights! New plan. The one, who kills the Ogre, will be named champion. How about him. Oh, hey. Now, come on. Can't we just settle this over a pint? No? All right then. Come on. Hey Shrek! Let me, let me! The chair! Give him the chair! Thank you. Thank you, very much. I'm here until Thursday. Try the wheel! Shall I give the order sir? No. I have a better idea. People of Duloc. I give you our champion! What? Congratulation, Ogre. You've won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. Quest? I'm already on a quest. A quest to get my swamp back! -Your swamp? -Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairytale creatures. Indeed. All right Ogre, I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me and I'll give you your swamp back. Exactly the way it was? Down to the last slime covered toast tool. -And the squatters? -As good as gone. What kind of quest? Ok, let me get this straight! We gonna go find the dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back the swamp, which you only don't have, 'cause he filled it with full of freaks on the first place. -Is that about right? -You know what? Maybe there is a good reason, donkeys shouldn't talk. I don't get it Shrek. Why didn't you just pull some old Ogre stuff on them? You know, ??? . Grab his bones to make you brave. You know the whole Ogre trick. Oh, you know what. Maybe I could have decapitated entire village and put their heads on plate. Got a knife, cut open their spleens and drink their fluids. Does that sound good to you? A, no, not really, no. For your information, there is a lot more to Ogres than people think. -Example. -Example? OK, A-a-m, Ogres are like onions. -They stink? -Yes, no. -O, they make you cry. -No. Oh, you leave them out on the sun and they get all brown and start ??? little wild hairs? No! Layers! Onions have layers. Ogres have layers. Onions have layers. You get it? We both have layers. O, you both have layers. You know not everybody likes onions. Cake! Everybody loves cakes. Cakes have layers. I don't care what everyone likes. Ogres are not like cakes. You know what else everyone likes? Paffe. Have you ever met a person and you say: "Hey, let's get some paffe" and they say I don't like paffe. Paffe is delicious. No! You tensed, irritating, miniature peace of barden. Ogres are like onions. End of story. Bye, bye. See you lather. Paffe is maybe the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet. You know I think I've preferred your humming. Do you have a tissue or something, 'cause I'm making a mess. Just the word paffe has made me start slimying Why, Shrek, did you do that? Man you got to warn somebody before you just crack one off. My mouth was opened and everything. Believe me donkey, if it was me, you'd be dead. It's brimstone. We must be getting close. Yeah, right, brimstone. Don't be talking ??? brimstone. I know what I smell and ??? no brimstone. And they don't come of stone neither. Sure it's big enough, but look at the location. Oh, Shrek, remember when you said that Ogres have layers? Oh, yeah. Well, I have a confession to make. Donkeys don't have layers. We wear ??? sleeves. Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves. -You know what I mean. -Oh, you can't tell me you're afraid of highs. No, I'm just a little uncomfortable of being on a rickety bridge over boiling lake of lava! Come on donkey, I'm right here beside you. Ok? For emotional support. We'll just hackle this thing together one little baby step after time. -Really? -Really really. Ok. That makes me feel so much better. Just keep moving and don't look down. Don't look down, don't look down. Shrek! I'm looking down! I can't do this. Just let me off right now, please. -But you're already half way. -Yeah, but I know that half is safe. Ok, fine. I don't have time for this. You go back. Shrek, no, wait. Don't do that! Oh, I'm sorry. Do what? -Oh. This? -Yes, that! Yes, yes. Do it. OK. -No, Shrek! -I'm doing it. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, I'm gonna die. That will do Donkey, that will do. Cool. So where is this fire breathing pain in the neck anyway? Inside. Waiting for us to rescue her. I was talking about the dragon Shrek. -Are you afraid? -No, but shhhhh. Oh, good. Me neither. Because there's nothing wrong with being afraid. Here's a..., something responsible of the situation. Not to mention dangerous situation. And there's dragon that breathes fire. I'm sure he's meaner than a cow or anything, but they're scare. You know what I mean. I'm sure he's heavier than a cow... Donkey. Two things. Ok? Shut, up. Now go over there and see if you can find any stairs. Stairs? I thought we were looking for the princess. The princess will be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest tower. What makes you think she'll be there? I read it 
in a book once. Cool. You handle the dragon, I'll handle the stairs. Oh, I'll find those stairs. I'll ???. That's right. Those stairs won't know which way they go. The drafting stairs, ??? Don't mess with me. I'm the stair master. I'm master of the stairs. I wish I had a stair right here right here now, I'd step all over it. Well, at least we know where the princess is. -But where is the... -Dragon! Donkey, look out! Got you. Oh, what large teeth you have. I mean, white sparkling teeth. You probably hear this all the time from your food, but you must bleach yourself, because that is one dashing smile you got there. And do I detect the hint of minty freshness? And you know what else? You're a girl dragon. Oh, sure. I mean 'course you're a girl dragon, 'cause you're just ricking the feminine beauty out. What's the matter with you? Do you have something in your eye? Man, I'd really love to stay, but you know I'm a asthmatic and I don't know if we would worked out. You'd be blowing smoke and stuff. Shrek! No, Shrek! Shrek! -Wake up! -What? Are you princess Fiona? I am. Awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me. Oh, that's nice. Now let's go. But wait, sir knight. This be our first meeting. Should not be wonderful, romantic moment? Yeah. Sorry lady there's no time. Hey, what are you doing? You know, you should sweep me out of my feet. Out through the window and down the rope by to your valued steed. You've had a lot of time to plan this, haven't you? Uh-um. But we have to sing through this moment. You can residing of a poem to me. A ballad, a sonnet, a libretti. Or something. I don't think so. Well, can I at least know a name of my champion? Shrek. So, Shrek. I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude. Thanks. -You didn't slay the dragon? -It's not my job to do this. Now, come on! But this isn't right. ??? That's what all the other knights did. Yeah. Right before they burst in the flame. That's not the point. Wait. Where are you going? Exit is over there. Well, I have to save my ass. What kind of knight are you? One of a kind. ...rush into a physical relationship. I'm not that emotionally ready for commitment of a this magnitude. That was the word I was looking for. Magnitude. Hey, that is unwanted physical contact. Hey, what are you doing? Ok, ok, let's just back up a little and take this one step at the time. I mean, we really should get to know each other first, you know what am I saying. As friends, maybe even as ??? Hey don't do that. That's my tail. That's ma personal tail. And you're going to tear it off.... Oh, no. No! -It talks?! -Yeah. It's getting to shut up, that's a trick. Ok, you two. Head for the exit. I'll take care of the dragon. Ruuuuun! You did it. You rescued me. Amizing, you're wonderful. You're a ... ...a little unorthodox I admit, but by deed is great and by heart is pure. I'm entirely in your debt. And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed. I hope you heard that. She called me a noble steed. She thinks I'm a steed. The battle is won. You may remove your helmet good sir knight. -Aah, no. -Why not? I have helmet hair. Please. I wouldst look upon the face of my rescuer. Oh, no, you wouldn't, dust. But, how will you kiss me? What? That wasn't in a job description. -Maybe it's a perk? -No. It's destiny. You must know how it goes. A princess locked in a tower and besieged by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight. And then they share true love's first kiss. With Shrek? You think, wait... ...you think Shrek is your true love? Well, yes. You think that Shrek is your true love. What is so funny? Let's just say, I'm not your type, ok? Of course you are. You're my rescuer. Now, now remove your helmet. Look. I really don't think this is a good idea. -Just take off the helmet. -I'm not going to. -Take it off! -No! -Now! -Ok, easy. As you command your highness. You're an Ogre. Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming. Well, yes, actually. Oh no. This is all wrong. You're not supposed to be an Ogre. Princess, I was sent to rescue you by lord Farquaad, ok? He's the one, who wants to marry you. Well, then why didn't he come to rescue me? Good question. You should ask him that, when we get there. But I have to be rescued by my true love. Not by some Ogre and his pet. Well so much for noble steed. Look princess. You're not making my job any easier. Well I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem. You can tell lord Farquaad that if he wants to rescue me properly, I'll be waiting for him right here. Hey, I'm no ones messenger boy, all right? -I'm a delivery boy. -You wouldn't dare. -You coming donkey? -Put me down! Yeah, I'm right behind you. Put me down or you will suffer the consequences. This is not dignified. Put me down. Ok, here's another question. Let's say that a woman 'digged' you, but you don't really like her, that way. Now, how you let her down real easy, so her feelings aren't hurt? But you don't get burned to a crisp neither. How do you do this? Just tell her, she's not your true love. Everyone knows it what happens when you 
find... Hey! The sooner we get to Duloc, the better. Oh, yeah. You gonna love it there princess. It's beautiful. And what of my groom to be, lord Farquaad. What's he like? Well, let me put it this way, princess. Men of Farquaad's stature are in short supply. Oh no, Shrek. There are those who think little of him. Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You know, you're just jealous that you can never measure up to a great ruler like lord Farquaad. Yeah. Well maybe you're right princess. But I'd like you do that measuring when you see him tomorrow Tomorrow? It will take that long? -Shouldn't we stop to make camp? -No. That would take longer. We can keep going. But there are robbers in the woods. Whoa, time out Shrek. Camp is definitely something that sounds good. Hey. Come on. I'm scarier than anything we're gonna see in this forest. I need to find somewhere to camp, now! Hey, over here. Shrek, we can do better than that. Now, I don't think this is decent for princess. No, no, it's perfect. It just needs a few homey touches. Homey touches? Like what? A door. Well, gentleman I'll be d..., good night. Do you want me to come in and read you a bedtime story, 'cause I will... I said good night! Shrek! What are you doing? I just..., you know... Oh, come on, I was just kidding. And that one, that's Throwback. The only Ogre to ever spit over three wheat fields. Right. Yeah. Hey, can you tell my future form these stars? Well, the stars don't tell the future, Donkey. They tell stories. Look. There's Blodna, the "Flatulent" You can guess what he is famous for. All right. Now I know you're making this up. No. Look. There he is and there's the group of hunters running away from his stag. Man, there ain't nothing, but a bunch of little dots. You know donkey, sometimes things are more than they appear. Forget it. Hey Shrek. What are you gonna do when we get our swamp back, anyway? -Our swamp? -You know. When we're through rescuing the princess and all that stuff. We? Donkey, there is no we. There's no our. There's just me and my swamp. And the first thing I'm gonna do, is build a ten foot wall around my land. You cut me deep Shrek, you cut me real deep just now. You know, what I think? I think this whole wall thing is just a way to keep somebody out. No, do you think? -Are you hiding something? -Never mind Donkey. Oh, this is another one of those onion things, isn't it? No. This is one of those drop it and leave it alone things. -Why don't you want to talk about it? -Why do you want to talk about it? -Oh, Why you block? -I'm not blocking. -Oh yes you are. -Donkey, I'm warning you. -Who are you trying to keep out? Just tell me that Shrek. Who? Everyone, ok? -Oh, now we're getting somewhere. -Oh, for 'the love of pit'. Hey, what's your problem Shrek? What do you got against the whole world anyway? Look. I'm not the one with the problem, ok? It's the world that seems to have a problem with me. People take one look at me and go: AAA... Help! Run! A big stupid ugly Ogre. They judge me, before they even know me. That's why I'm better off alone. You know what? When we met, I didn't think you're just a big stupid, ugly Ogre. Yeah, I know. So, a... Are there any donkeys up there? Well, there's a Cabby. The small and annoying. Ok, ok. I see him, now. Big shining one, right there. That one, over there? That's the moon. Again. Show me again. Mirror, mirror, show her to me. Show me the princess. Perfect. Yeah. You know I like like that. Oh come on baby... -Donkey. Wake up. -What? -Wake up. Morning. How do you like your eggs? -Good morning princess. -What's all this about? You know, we kind of got of to a bad start yesterday and I wanted to make it up to you. I mean, after all, you did rescue me. Thanks. Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead of us. -Shrek! -What? It's a compliment. Better out than in I always say. But that's no way to behave in front of a princess. -Thanks. -She's as nasty as you are. You know. You're not exactly what I've expected. Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you get to know them. Princess! What are you doing? ???mon shery, for I am your saviour. And I am rescuing you from this green...beast. Hey! That's my princess. Go find your own. Please, monster. Can't you see I'm a little busy here? Look, pal. I don't know who you think you are. Oh, of course. How rude that was. Please, let me introduce myself. Oh marry men! Man, that was annoying. Oh, you little... Shall we? ???all the forin??? Whoa, hold on, now. Where did that come from? -What? -That. Back there. That was amazing. Where did you learn that? Well, when one lives alone one has to learn these things in case there's a... There is an arrow in your butt. What? Oh, would you look at that. Oh, no... This is all my fault. I'm so sorry. -What's wrong? -Shrek's hurt. -Shrek's hurt? Shrek's hurt! -Oh, no. Shrek's going to die. -Donkey, I'm ok. You can't do this to me Shrek. I'm too young for you to die. Keep your legs elevated. Turn your head ???. -Does anyone 
know how to handle... -Donkey! Calm down. If you want to help Shrek, run into woods and find me a blue flower with red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Ok, I'm on it. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Don't die Shrek. And if you see a long tunnel, stay away from the light! -Donkey! -Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. -What are the flowers for? -For getting rid of the Donkey. Now, you hold still and I'll yank this thing out. -Hey! Easy with the yanking. -I'm sorry, but it has to come out. No, no. It's tender. What you're doing here is the opposite... -Don't move. -Ok, look. Time out. -Would you... Ok. What do you propose we do? Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. This would be so much easier if I wasn't colorblind. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Hold on, Shrek. I'm coming! Not good. Ok, ok, I can lose it. It's just about it. Nothing happened. We were just a... Look if you want to be alone, all you had to do is ask, ok? Oh, come on. That's the last thing on my mind. The princess here was just... Au! Hey, what's that? Is that... There it is, princess. -Your future awaits you. -That's Duloc? Yeah. I know. You'll shrink things lord Farquaad is compensating for something, which I think needs, he has a I guess we better move on. Sure, but Shrek... -I'm worried about Donkey. -What? I mean. Look at him. He doesn't look so good. -What are you talking about? I'm fine. -Well, that's what they always say. And the next thing you know you're on your back. -Dead! -You know she's right. You look awful. -Do you want to sit down? -You know, I'll make you up some tea. Well, I won't say nothing, but I've got this twinge in my neck. And if I turn my neck like this, look. Au, see? -He's hungry. I'll find us some dinner. -I'll get the firewood. Hey, where are you going? Oh man, I can't feel my thumbs. I don't have any thumbs!!! I think I need a hug. This is good. This is really good. -What is this? -Wheat rat. -Rotisserie style. -No kidding. -Oh, this is delicious. -Well, they also great in stews. Now, I don't mean to brag, but I make a mean wheat rat stew. I guess I'll be dining a little different late tomorrow night. Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp sometime. I'll cook all kinds of stuff for you. Swamp toast, soup fish, eye tartar. You name it. I'd like that. -Ah... , princess? -Yes, Shrek? I'm a.... I was wondering. Are you... a... Are you gonna eat that? Man, isn't this romantic. Just look at that sunset. Sunset?! Oh, no. It's late. It's very late. -What? -Wait a minute. I see what's going on here. You're afraid of the dark. Aren't you? Yes, yes. That's it. That's, I'm terrified. You know I'll better go inside. But don't feel bad, princess. I used to be afraid of the dark too. Until... Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of the dark. -Good night. -Good night. Ahh. Now I really see what's going on here. Oh, what are you talking about. Hey I don't wanna even hear. Look, I'm an animal and I got instincts. And I know that you two are digging on each other. I can feel it. Oh, you're crazy. I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad. Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell the fairemones. Just go in there and tell her how you feel. There's nothing to tell. Besides, even if I did tell her that... well you know. I'm not saying that I do, 'cause I don't. She's a princess and I'm... ...an Ogre. Yeah, an Ogre. -Hey, where are you going? -To get more firewood. Princess. Princess Fiona? Princess, where are you? Princess? It's very spooky in here and are we playing little games. -No, no. -Help! Shrek! Shrek! -No. -Shrek! -It's ok. It's ok. -What did you do with the princess? -Donkey, shhh. I'm the princess. -It's me, in this body. -Oh my god. You ate the princess. -Can you hear me? -Donkey! Listen, keep breathing. I'll get you out of there! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! This is me. Princess? What happened to you? You're a... different. -I'm ugly, ok? -Yeah. Was it something that you ate? 'Cause I told Shrek those rats were a bad idea. -You are what you eat, I say. -No. I've been this way as long as I can remember. What do you mean? Look, I've never seen you like this before. It only happens when the sun goes down. By night one way, by day another. This shall be the norm until you find true love's first kiss. Then, take love's true form... -Oh, that's beautiful. I didn't know you wrote poetry. -It's the spell. When I was a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me. Every night I become this. This horrible ugly beast. I was placed in a tower to await the day when my true love would rescue me. That's why I have to marry lord Farquaad tomorrow, before the sun sets and he sees me, like this? All right, all right. Calm down. Look, it's not that bad. You're not that ugly. Wait, wait, I'll not lie, you are ugly. But you only look like this at night. Shrek's ugly 24/7. But Donkey, I'm a princess. And this is not how a princess is meant to look. Princess. How about if you don't marry Farquaad? I have to. Only my true love's kiss can brake the spell. But you know, 
you're kind of an Ogre. And Shrek... Well you've got a lot in common. Shrek? Princess, I... How is it going first of all? Good? Good for me to. I'm ok. I saw this flower and thought of you because it's pretty. And, well, I don't really like it, but I thought you may like it, because you're pretty. But I like you anyway. A.... I'm in trouble. Ok, here we go. Who could ever love a piece so hideous and ugly? Princess and ugly don't go together. That's why I can't stay here with Shrek, but only chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love. Don't you see, Donkey? That's just how it has to be. It's the only way to break the spell. Well, at least you've got tell Shrek the truth. No, no. You can't breathe the word. No one must ever know. What's the point of being unable to talk? You got to keep secrets. Promise you won't tell. Promise! You know, before this is over, I'm going to need whole lot of serious therapies. All right, all right. I won't tell him. But you should. Look at my eye twitching. I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him. I tell him not. I tell him! Shrek! Shrek! There's something I want ... Shrek. Are you all right? Perfect. Never been better. I... There's something I have to tell you. You don't have to tell me anything, princess. I heard enough last night. -You've heard what I said? -Every word. I thought you'd understand? Oh, I understand! Like you said, who could love a hideous, ugly beast! -I thought that wouldn't matter to you. -Yeah, well, it does. Ah, right on time. Princess. I brought you a little something. What I missed? What I missed? -Princess Fiona. -As promised. Now hand it over. Very well, Ogre. The deed to your swamp. Cleared out as agreed. Take it and go. Before I change my mind. Forgive me princess for startling you, but you startled me. For I've never seen such a radiant beauty before. -I am lord Farquaad. -Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no... forgive me my lord for I was just saying short... farewell. Oh. That is so sweet. You don't have to raise good manners on the Ogre. -It's not like it has feelings. -No. You're right. It doesn't. Princess Fiona, beautiful fair flawless Fiona, I ask your hand in marriage. Will you be the perfect bride for the perfect groom? Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would make... Excellent! I'll start the plans for tomorrow we wedd... No! I mean I... Why wait? Let's get married today. Before sunset. Oh, anxious are we? You're right. The sooner, the better. There's so much to do. There is the camera, the cake, the band, the guests... Captain! Round up some guests. Farewell Ogre. Shrek, what are you doing? You let her get away. -Yeah, so what. -Shrek. There's something about her that you don't know. -I talked to her last night. She's... -Yeah I know you talked to her last night. You're great pal, aren't you? Now, if you two are such good friend, why didn't you follow her home? -Shrek. I want to go with you. -I told you, didn't I? You're not coming home with me. I live alone. My swamp, me and nobody else! Understand? Nobody! Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys! -But. I thought... -Yeah. You know what? You thought wrong. Shrek. Donkey? What are you doing? I was thinking of all the people, you would recognize a wall when you see one. Well, yeah. But the wall supposed to go around my swamp. Not through it. It is around your half. See? That's your half and this is my half. Oh, your half? Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess. I did half the work. I get half the booty. Now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks like your head -Back off! -No. You back off! -This is my swamp. -Our swamp. -Let go, Donkey! -You let go! -Stubborn jackass. -Smelly Ogre. Fine! Hey, hey, come back here. I'm not through with you, yet. -Well, I'm through with you! -Well, you know. You were always me, me, me. Well, guess what? Now it's my turn! So you just shut up and pay attention! You are mean to me, you insult me, you don't appreciate anything that I do! You're always pushing me around or pushing me away. Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back? Because that's what friend do. They forgive each other! Oh, yeah. You're right Donkey. I forgive you for stabbing me in the back! You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy. You're afraid of your own feelings. -Go away. -See? There you are, doing it again. Just like you did it to Fiona. And all she ever do, was like you. Maybe even love you. Love me? She said I was ugly! A hideous creature. -I heard that you two were talking. -She wasn't talking about you. She was talking about... ...somebody else. She wasn't talking about me? Well then, who was she talking about? No way, I'm not saying anything. You won't listen to me, right? Right? -Donkey. -No! Ok, look. I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry. I guess I am just a big stupid, ugly Ogre. Can you forgive me? -Hey, that's the friends are for, right? -Right. -Friends? -Friends. So? What did Fiona said about me? Why are you asking me for? Why don't you just go ask her. The wedding! We'll never make it in 
time! Never fear! For where there is a will, there is a way. And I have I way. Donkey? -I guess this is just my act of magnetism. -Oh, come here, you. All right. All right. Don't get all started. No one likes kissass. All right, hop on. Hold on tight. I hadn't have a chance to install seat belts, yet. People of Duloc. We gather here today to bear witness to reunion of our new king... Excuse me. Could you just skip ahead to "I do's"? Go on. Go ahead and have some fun, if we need you, I'll whistle. How about that? Shrek, wait, wait a minute. You want to do this right, don't you? -What are you talking about? -It's the line, it's the line you got to wait for. The priest is going to say: "Speak now or forever hold your peace". And that's where you say: "I object". -I don't have time for this. -Wait, wait. What are you doing? Listen to me! Look, you love this woman, don't you? -Yes. -You want to hold her! -Yes. -Please her! -Yes! Then you got to, got to try a little tender love. -The chicks love that romantic crap. -All right. Cut it out. When does this guy say the line? We got to check it out. And as so by the power of these two... What do you see? -I now pronounce you... -There they go! -...he all ready said it. -Oh, for 'the love of pit'. I object! Shrek? Oh, now what does he want? Hi, everyone. Having a good time, aren't you? I love Duloc, first of all. Very clean. -What are you doing here? -Really, it's rude enough being alive, when no one wants you. But showing up uninvited to a wedding... -Fiona! I need to talk to you. -Oh, now you wanna talk? Well it's a little late for that. So if you'll excuse me. -But you can't marry him! -And why not? Because, because he's just marrying you so he can be king. -Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him. -He's not your true love. -What do you know about true love? -Well, I ...I'm in... Oh, this is precious. The Ogre has fallen in love with the princess. Laugh. Shrek. Is this true? Who cares. It's preposterious. Fiona, my love, we gonna kiss away for our happily ever after. Now kiss me! By night one way, by day another. I wanted to show you before. Well. That explains a lot. Oh. It's disgusting. Guards, guards. I order you to get them out of my sight. -Now! Get them! Get them, both! -No! This marriage is minding, and that makes me king. See? See? -Shrek! -No. -Don't just stand there, you dogs. -Get out of my way. No! Shrek! -And as for you my wife. -Fiona! I'll have you locked back in that tower for the rest of your days! I will have order. I will have potential. I will have... All right, nobody move! I got a dragon here and I'm not afraid to use it. I'm a donkey on the edge! Celebrity marriages. They never last, do they? Go ahead Shrek. -Fiona? -Yes, Shrek? I love you. Really? Really, really. I love you too. A time for true love's first kiss... Fiona? Fiona? Are you all right? Yes. But I don't understand. I'm supposed to be beautiful. But you are beautiful. I was hoping this would be a happy ending. God bless us, everyone.


Shrek 2: 

1.
1 INT. CASTLE INTERIOR 1
There is a bed onstage behind a silky curtain, backlit.
PRINCE CHARMING (OS)
Once upon a time in a kingdom far,
far away, the king and queen were
blessed with a beautiful baby girl.
And throughout the land, everyone
was happy... until the sun went down
and they saw that their daughter was
cursed with a frightful enchantment
that took hold each and every night.
Desperate, they sought the help of a
fairy godmother who had them lock
the young princess away in a tower,
there to await the kiss... of the
handsome Prince Charming.
(enters gallantly onstage)
It was he who would chance the
perilous journey through blistering
cold and scorching desert traveling
for many days and nights, risking
life and limb to reach the Dragon's
keep. For he was the bravest, and
most handsome... in all the land.
(looks at the audience)
And it was destiny that his kiss
would break the dreaded curse. He
alone would climb to the highest
room of the tallest tower to enter
the princess's chambers, cross the
room to her sleeping silhouette,
pull back the gossamer curtains to
find her...
(pulls back the curtain to
reveal WOLF in the bed.
Gasps)
WOLF
What?
CHARMING
Princess... Fiona?
WOLF
No!
CHARMING
(relieved)
Thank heavens. Where is she?
2.
WOLF
She's on her honeymoon.
CHARMING
Honeymoon? With whom?
2 EXT. THE SWAMP 2
SHREK
It's so good to be home! Just you
and me and...
DONKEY
(offstage)
One is the loneliest number that you
ever do...
(enters)
Two can be as bad as one...
SHREK
Donkey?
DONKEY
Shrek! Fiona! Aren't you two a sight
for sore eyes! Give us a hug, Shrek,
you old love machine. And look at
you, Mrs. Shrek. How 'bout a side of
sugar for the steed?
SHREK
Donkey, what are you doing here?
DONKEY
Taking care of your love nest for
you.
SHREK
Oh, you mean like... sorting the
mail and watering the plants?
DONKEY
Yeah, and feeding the fish!
SHREK
I don't have any fish.
DONKEY
You did.
(looks around for the
fish)
SHREK
3.
Look at the time. I guess you'd
better be going.
DONKEY
Don't you want to tell me about your
trip? Or how about a game of
Parcheesi?
FIONA
Actually, Donkey? Shouldn't you be
getting home to Dragon?
DONKEY
Oh, yeah, that. I don't know. She's
been all moody and stuff lately. I
thought I'd move in with you.
FIONA
You know we're always happy to see
you, Donkey.
SHREK
But Fiona and I are married now. We
need a little time, you know, to be
together. Just with each other.
Alone.
DONKEY
Say no more. You don't have to worry
about a thing. I will always be here
to make sure nobody bothers you.
SHREK
Donkey!
DONKEY
Yes, roomie?
SHREK
You're bothering me.
DONKEY
Oh, OK. All right, cool. I guess...
Me and Pinocchio was going to catch
a tournament, anyway, so...Maybe
I'll see y'all Sunday for a barbecue
or something.
SHREK
He'll be fine. Now, where were we?
(giggles)
Oh.I think I remember. Donkey!
DONKEY
4.
I know, I know! Alone! I'm going!
I'm going. What do you want me to
tell these other guys?
ROYAL MESSENGER enters to fanfare.
MESSENGER
(clears throat)
"Dearest Princess Fiona. You are
hereby summoned to the Kingdom of
Far, Far Away for a royal ball in
celebration of your marriage at
which time the King will bestow his
royal blessing... upon you and
your...uh... Prince Charming. Love,
the King and Queen of Far, Far Away.
aka Mom and Dad."
FIONA
Mom and Dad?
SHREK
Prince Charming?
DONKEY
Royal ball? Can I come?
SHREK
We're not going.
FIONA & DONKEY
What?
SHREK
I mean, don't you think they might
be a bit...shocked to see you like
this?
FIONA
Well, they might be a bit surprised.
But they're my parents, Shrek. They
love me. And don't worry. They'll
love you, too.
SHREK
Yeah, right. Somehow I don't think
I'll be welcome at the country club.
FIONA
Stop it. They're not like that.
SHREK
How do you explain Sergeant Pompous
and the Fancy Pants Club Band?
5.
FIONA
Oh, come on! You could at least give
them a chance.
SHREK
To do what? Sharpen their
pitchforks?
FIONA
No! They just want to give you their
blessing.
SHREK
Oh, great. Now I need their
blessing?
FIONA
If you want to be a part of this
family, yes!
SHREK
Who says I want to be part of this
family?
FIONA
You did! When you married me!
SHREK
Well, there's some fine print for
you!
FIONA
(exasperated sigh)
So that's it. You won't come?
SHREK
Trust me. It's a bad idea. We are
not going! And that's final!
ALL exit.
3 EXT. SHREK SWAMP 3
SHREK, DONKEY and FIONA re-enter with GINGY and PINOCHIO.
SHREK is carrying luggage.
GINGY

the ‘warning, Ogres sign’)
Don't worry! We'll take care of
everything.
6.
PINOCHIO
Hey, wait for me.
DONKEY
Hit it! Move 'em on! Head 'em up!
Head 'em up, move 'em on! Head 'em
up! Move ‘em on, Rawhide! Knock 'em
out! Pound 'em dead! Make 'em tea!
Buy 'em drinks! Meet their mamas!
Milk 'em hard! Rawhide! Yeehaw!
SHREK, FIONA and DONKEY pass back and forth on the stage
every time the E/E (Enter/exit symbol appears)
DONKEY
Are we there yet?
SHREK
No.
DONKEY
Are we there yet?
FIONA
Not yet.
DONKEY
OK, are we there yet?
SHREK
No.
DONKEY
Are we there yet?
FIONA
No!
DONKEY
Are we there yet?
SHREK
Yes.
DONKEY
Really?
SHREK
No!
DONKEY
Are we there yet?
SHREK & FIONA
7.
No!
DONKEY
Are we there yet?
SHREK
(mimics)
Are we there yet?
DONKEY
That's not funny. That's really
immature.
SHREK
That's not funny. That's really
immature.
DONKEY
This is why nobody likes ogres.
SHREK
This is why nobody likes ogres.
DONKEY
Your loss!
SHREK
Your loss!
DONKEY
I'm gonna just stop talking.
SHREK
Finally!
DONKEY
This is taking forever, Shrek.
There's no in-flight movie or
nothing!
SHREK
The Kingdom of Far, Far Away,
Donkey. That's where we're going.
Far, far --
(softly)
away!
DONKEY
All right, all right, I get it. I'm
just so darn bored.
SHREK
(groans)
Are we there yet?
8.
FIONA

Yes!
DONKEY
Oh, finally!
ALL exit.

KING and QUEEN enter off-stage right.
FIONA
Well, this is it.
KING
This is it.
MESSENGER
This is it.
(exits)
SHREK
(chuckles)
So...you still think this was a good
idea?
FIONA
Of course! Look. Mom and Dad look
happy to see us.
KING
Who on earth are they?
QUEEN
I think that's our little girl.
KING
That's not little! That's a really
big problem. Wasn't she supposed to
kiss Prince Charming and break the
spell?
QUEEN
9.
Well, he's no Prince Charming, but
they do look...
SHREK
Happy now? We came. We saw them. Now
let's go before they light the
torches.
FIONA
They're my parents.
SHREK
Hello? They locked you in a tower.
FIONA
That was for my own...
KING
Good! Here's our chance. Let's go
back inside and pretend we're not
home.
QUEEN
Harold, we have to be...
SHREK
Quick! While they're not looking we
can make a run for it.
FIONA
Shrek, stop it! Everything's gonna
be...
KING
A disaster! There is no way...
FIONA
You can do this.
Both parties begin moving toward eachother
SHREK
I really...
KING
Really...
QUEEN
don't...
SHREK
want...
FIONA
10.
to...
KING
be...
SHREK
Here!
FIONA
Mom... Dad...I'd like you to meet my
husband... Shrek.
SHREK
Well, um...It's easy to see where
Fiona gets her good looks from.
(chuckles nervously)
5 DONKEY ENTERS SHAKING OFF A GUARD 5
DONKEY
(off-stage)
What do you mean, "not on the list"?
Don't tell me you don't know who I
am.
(enters)
What's happening, everybody? Thanks
for waiting. I had the hardest time
getting into this place.
KING
No! No! Bad donkey! Bad! Go!
FIONA
No, Dad! It's all right. It's all
right. He's with us. He helped
rescue me from the dragon.
DONKEY
That's me: the noble steed.
SHREK
Oh, boy.
QUEEN
So, Fiona, tell us about where you
live.
FIONA
Well...Shrek owns his own land.
Don't you, honey?
SHREK
11.
Oh, yes! It's in an enchanted forest
abundant in squirrels and cute
little duckies and...
DONKEY
(laughing)
What? I know you ain't talking about
the swamp.
KING
An ogre from a swamp. Oh! How
original.
QUEEN
I suppose that would be a fine place
to raise the children.
6 SHREK AND KING COUGH INVOLUNTARILY 6
SHREK
It's a bit early to be thinking
about that, isn't it?
KING
Indeed.
QUEEN
Harold!
SHREK
What's that supposed to mean?
FIONA
Dad. It's great, OK?
KING
For his type, yes.
SHREK
My type?
KING
I suppose any grandchildren I could
expect from you would be...
SHREK
Ogres, yes!
QUEEN
Not that there's anything wrong with
that. Right, Harold?
KING
12.
Oh, no! No! Of course, not! That is,
assuming you don't eat your own
young!
FIONA
Dad!
SHREK
No, we usually prefer the ones
who've been locked away in a tower!
FIONA
Shrek, please!
KING
I only did that because I love her.
SHREK
Aye, day care or dragon-guarded
castle.
KING
You wouldn't understand. You're not
her father!
QUEEN
Harold!
FIONA
Shrek!
SHREK
Fiona!
KING
Fiona!
FIONA
Mom!
QUEEN
Harold...
DONKEY
Donkey!
FIONA exits crying.
7 EXT. STREETS OF FAR FAR AWAY 7
FIONA enters, she hears the voice of FAIRY GODMOTHER
FAIRY GODMOTHER (FG)
13.
Your fallen tears have called to me
So, here comes my sweet remedy I
know what every princess needs For
her to live life happily...
Both gasp.
FG
Oh, my dear. Oh, look at you. You're
all grown up.
FIONA
Who are you?
FG
Oh, sweet pea! I'm your fairy
godmother.
FIONA
I have a fairy godmother?
FG
Shush, shush. Now, don't worry. I'm
here to make it all better. With
just a wave of my magic wand, your
troubles will soon be gone. For
example, how about a sporty carriage
to ride in style, with a sexy manboy chauffeur named Kyle?
KYLE enters.
FIONA
Thank you very much, Fairy
Godmother, but...
SHREK enters.
SHREK
Fiona? Fiona.
FIONA
Oh, uh...Fairy Godmother... I'd like
you to meet my husband, Shrek.
FG
Your husband? What? What did you
say? When did this happen?
FIONA
Shrek is the one who rescued me.
FG
But that can't be right.
14.
SHREK
Oh, great, more relatives!
FIONA
She's just trying to help.
SHREK
Good! She can help us pack. Get your
coat, dear. We're leaving.
FIONA
What? I don't want to leave. When
did you decide this?
SHREK
Shortly after arriving.
FIONA
Look, I'm sorry...
FG
No, that's all right. I need to go,
anyway. But remember, dear. If you
should ever need me...
happiness...is just a teardrop away.
SHREK
Thanks, but we've got all the
happiness we need. Happy, happy,
happy...
FG
So I see. Let's go, Kyle.
FIONA
Very nice, Shrek.
SHREK
What? I told you coming here was a
bad idea.
FIONA
You could've at least tried to get
along with my father.
SHREK
I don't think I was going to get
Daddy's blessing, even if I did want
it.
FIONA
Do you think it might be nice if
somebody asked me what I wanted?
15.
SHREK
Sure. Do you want me to pack for
you?
FIONA
You're unbelievable! You're behaving
like a...
SHREK
Go on! Say it!
FIONA
Like an ogre!
SHREK
Here's a news flash for you! Whether
your parents like it or not...I am
an ogre! And guess what, Princess?
That's not about to change.
FIONA
I've made changes for you, Shrek.
Think about that.
(exits)
DONKEY
That's real smooth, Shrek. "I'm an
ogre!"
8 INT. KING AND QUEEN’S BEDCHAMBER 8
KING
I knew this would happen.
QUEEN
You should. You started it.
KING
I can hardly believe that, Lillian.
He's the ogre. Not me.
QUEEN
I think, Harold, you're taking this
a little too personally. This is
Fiona's choice.
KING
But she was supposed to choose the
prince we picked for her. I mean,
you expect me to give my blessings
to this... thing?
QUEEN
16.
Fiona does. And she'll never forgive
you if you don't. I don't want to
lose our daughter again, Harold. Oh,
you act as if love is totally
predictable. Don't you remember when
we were young? We used to walk down
by the lily pond and...
KING
they were in bloom...
QUEEN
Our first kiss.
KING
It's not the same! I don't think you
realize that our daughter has
married a monster!
QUEEN
Oh, stop being such a drama king.
KING
Fine! Pretend there's nothing wrong!
La, di, da, di, da! Isn't it all
wonderful! I'd like to know how it
could get any worse!
FG
(out on the balcony)
Hello, Harold.
KING gasps.
QUEEN
What happened?
KING
Nothing, dear! Just the old crusade
wound playing up a bit! I'll just
stretch it out here for a while.
FC
We need to talk.
KING
Actually, Fairy Godmother, off to
bed.
(yawns)
Already taken my pills, and they
tend to make me a bit drowsy. So,
how about... we make this a quick
visit. What?
17.
(Bumps up against two
armed guards)
Oh, hello. Ha-ha-ha! So, what's new?
FG
You remember my son, Prince
Charming?
CHARMING enters.
KING
Is that you? My gosh! It's been
years. When did you get back?
CHARMING
Oh, about five minutes ago,
actually. After I endured blistering
winds, scorching desert...I climbed
to the highest room in the tallest
tower...
FG
Mommy can handle this. He endures
blistering winds and scorching
desert! He climbs to the highest
bloody room of the tallest bloody
tower...And what does he find? Some
gender-confused wolf telling him
that his princess is already
married.
KING
It wasn't my fault. He didn't get
there in time.
FG
Harold.
(GUARD reaches into his
pocket)
You’ve forced me to do something I
really don't want to do.
KING
(gasps)
What is that? What have you got
there?
GUARD pulls out a cellphone and gives it to FG.
FG
My diet is ruined! Yes, I’d like two
Renaissance Wraps, no mayo... chili
rings...
18.
CHARMING
I'll have the Medieval Meal.
FG
One Medieval Meal and, Harold...
Curly fries?
KING
No, thank you.
FG
Sourdough soft taco, then?
KING
No, really, I'm fine.
FG
Nothing else thanks.
(hangs up)
We made a deal, Harold, and I assume
you don't want me to go back on my
part.
KING
(sighs deeply)
Indeed not.
FG
So, Fiona and Charming will be
together.
KING
Yes.
FG
Believe me, Harold. It's what's
best. Not only for your
daughter...but for your Kingdom.
KING
What am I supposed to do about it?
FG
Use your imagination.
9 INT. AT A PUB IN THE WOODS 9
KING enters. A woman (UGLY STEPSISTER) is cleaning a glass
with her back to the audience.
KING
(clears throat)
19.
Excuse me. Uh... excuse me. I'm
looking for the Ugly Stepsister.
UGLY STEPSISTER turns around to reveal herself.
KING
Ah! There you are. Right. You see, I
need to have someone taken care of.
UGLY STEPSISTER
Who's the guy?
KING
Well, he's not a guy, per se. Um...
He's an ogre.
UGLY STEPSISTER
Hey, buddy, let me clue you in.
There's only one fellow who can
handle a job like that, and,
frankly...he don't like to be
disturbed.
KING
Where could I find him?
UGLY STEPSISTER point to the dark corner of the room.
KING
Hello?
MYSTERIOUS VOICE
Who dares speak to me?
KING
Sorry! I hope I'm not interrupting,
but I'm told you're the one to talk
to about an ogre problem?
VOICE
You are told correct. But for this,
I charge a great deal of money.
KING
Would... this be enough?
(holds up a heavy satchel
of coins)
VOICE
You have engaged my valuable
services, Your Majesty. Just tell me
where I can find this ogre.
20.
10 INT. CASTLE 10
SHREK is alone reading FIONA’s diary.
FIONA (OFFSTAGE)
Dear Diary... Sleeping Beauty is
having a slumber party tomorrow, but
Dad says I can't go. He never lets
me out after sunset. Dad says I'm
going away for a while. Must be like
some finishing school. Mom says that
when I'm old enough, my Prince
Charming will rescue me from my
tower and bring me back to my
family, and we'll all live happily
ever after. Mrs. Fiona Charming.
Mrs. Fiona Charming. Mrs. Fiona
Charming.
A knock on door.
KING
Sorry. I hope I'm not interrupting
anything.
SHREK
No, no. I was just reading a, uh...
a scary book.
KING
I was hoping you'd let me apologize
for my despicable behavior earlier.
SHREK
Okay...
KING
I don't know what came over me. Do
you suppose we could pretend it
never happened and start over...
SHREK
Look, Your Majesty, I just...
KING
Please. Call me Dad.
SHREK
Dad. We both acted like ogres. Maybe
we just need some time to get to
know each other.
KING
21.
Excellent idea! I was actually
hoping you might join me for a
morning hunt. A little father-son
time? I know it would mean the world
to Fiona. Shall we say, by the old
oak?
SHREK
Sure.
FADE OUT:
11 EXT. IN THE FOREST 11
SHREK
Face it, Donkey! We're lost.
DONKEY
We can't be lost. We followed the
King's instructions exactly. "Head
to the darkest part of the
woods...""Past the sinister trees
with scary-looking branches." The
bush shaped like Shirley Bassey!
SHREK
We passed that three times already!
DONKEY
You were the one who said not to
stop for directions.
SHREK
Oh, great. My one chance to fix
things up with Fiona's dad and I end
up lost in the woods with you!
DONKEY
Don't get huffy! I'm only trying to
help.
SHREK
I know! I know. I'm sorry, all
right?
DONKEY
Hey, don't worry about it.
SHREK
I just really need to make things
work with this guy.
DONKEY
22.
Yeah, sure. Now let's go bond with
Daddy.
SHREK hears purring.
SHREK
Well, well, well, Donkey. I know it
was kind of a tender moment back
there, but the purring?
DONKEY
What? I ain't purring.
SHREK
Sure. What's next? A hug?
DONKEY
Hey, Shrek. Donkeys don't purr. What
do you think I am, some kind of a...
PUSS IN BOOTS enters.
PUSS
Ha-ha! Fear me, if you dare!
SHREK
Look! A little cat.
DONKEY
Look out, Shrek! He got a piece!
SHREK
It's a cat, Donkey. Come here,
little kitty, kitty. Come on, little
kitty. Come here.
PUSS scratches SHREK’s outstretched hand.
PUSS
Now, ye ogre, pray for mercy
from...Puss... in Boots!
SHREK
I'll kill that cat!
PUSS
Ah-ha-ha!
(coughs, wheezes, retches,
coughs, chuckles)
Hairball.
DONKEY
Oh! That is nasty!
23.
SHREK
What should we do with him?
DONKEY
Take the sword and neuter him.
PUSS
Oh, no! Por favor! Please! I implore
you! It was nothing personal, Señor.
I was doing it only for my family.
My mother, she is sick. And my
father lives off the garbage! The
King offered me much in gold and I
have a litter of brothers...
SHREK
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Fiona's father
paid you to do this?
PUSS
The rich King? Sí.
SHREK
Well, so much for Dad's royal
blessing.
DONKEY
Don't feel bad. Almost everybody
that meets you wants to kill you.
SHREK
Maybe Fiona would've been better off
if I were some sort of Prince
Charming.
PUSS
That's what the King said. Oh, uh...
sorry. I thought that question was
directed at me.
DONKEY
Shrek, Fiona knows you'd do anything
for her.
SHREK
Well, it's not like I wouldn't
change if I could. I just... I just
wish I could make her happy. Hold
the phone... "Happiness. Just a tear
drop away." Donkey! Think of the
saddest thing that's ever happened
to you!
DONKEY
24.
Aw, man, where do I begin? First
there was the time that old farmer
tried to sell me for some magic
beans. Then this fool had a party
and he have the guests trying to pin
the tail on me. Then they got drunk
and start beating me with a stick,
going "Piñata!!" What is a piñata,
anyway?
SHREK
No, Donkey! I need you to cry!
DONKEY
Don't go projecting on me. I know
you're feeling bad, but you got to
(Puss steps on his foot)
Aaaahhh! You little, hairy, litterlicking sack of...
KYLE enters with a cart.
KYLE
Fairy Godmother is away from desk or
with a client. But I can help you
with your ‘Happiness problems’
(yawns)
FAIRY GODMOTHER enters and Kyle stands up straight very
quickly.
FG
Kyle, I’ve been looking everywhere
for you! Why aren’t you
(notices SHREK)
What in Grimm's name are you doing
here?
SHREK
Well, um, it seems that Fiona's not
exactly happy.
FG
Oh-ho-ho! And there's some question
as to why that is? Well, let's
explore that, shall we?
Cinderella."Lived happily ever
after." No ogres! Snow White. A
handsome prince. Oh, no ogres.
Sleeping Beauty. No ogres! Hansel
and Gretel? No! Thumbelina? No. the
Little Mermaid, Pretty Woman...No,
no, no! You see, ogres don't live
happily ever after.
25.
SHREK
All right, look, lady!
FG
Don't you point...those dirty green
sausages at me!
KYLE opens the cart to get a soda and SHREK notices the
potions.
SHREK
Ah... that's okay. We’ll go. Very
sorry to have wasted your time, Miss
Godmother.
FG
I need a Monte Cristo Sandwich now.
You’ve got me all worked up.
(exits)
SHREK looks at KYLE, smiles, then knocks him out.
DONKEY
Shrek, are you off your nut?
SHREK
Donkey, quiet and keep watch.
DONKEY
Keep watch? Yeah, I'll keep watch.
I'll watch that wicked witch come
and whammy a world of hurt up your
backside. I'll laugh, too. I'll be
giggling to myself.
SHREK opens the cart and passes potions to PUSS.
PUSS
Toad Stool Softener? Elfa Seltzer?
Hex Lax?
SHREK
Help me find "handsome."
PUSS
Hey! How about "Happily Ever After"?
SHREK
Well, what does it do?
PUSS
It says "Beauty Divine."
SHREK
26.
That'll have to do. She’s coming
back. Go, Donkey!
ALL exit. FG enters, with CHARMING following after.
FG
What happened here? Kyle! Clean this
up.
CHARMING
Mother!
FG
This isn't a good time, pumpkin.
Mama's working.
CHARMING
Whoa, what happened here?
FG
The ogre, that's what!
CHARMING
What? Where is he, Mom? I shall rend
his head from his shoulders! I will
smite him where he stands! He will
rue the very day he stole my kingdom
from me!
FG
Oh, put it away, Junior! You're
still going to be king. We'll just
have to come up with something
smarter.
KYLE
Pardon. Um...Everything is accounted
for, Fairy Godmother, except for one
potion.
FG
What?
(looks in the cart)
Oh...I do believe we can make this
work to our advantage.
12 INT. THE ROYAL CASTLE 12
QUEEN
Try to at least pretend you're
interested in your daughter's
wedding ball.
27.
KING
Honestly, Lillian, I don't think it
matters. How do we know there will
even be a ball?
FIONA
Mom. Dad.
KING
Oh, hello, dear. What's that,
Cedric? Right! Coming.
FIONA
Mom, have you seen Shrek?
QUEEN
I haven't. You should ask your
father. Be sure and use small words,
dear. He's a little slow this
morning.
CEDRIC
Can I help you, Your Majesty?
KING
Ah, yes! Um...Mmm! Exquisite. What
do you call this dish?
CEDRIC
That would be the dog's breakfast,
Your Majesty.
KING
Ah, yes. Very good, then. Carry on,
Cedric.
FIONA
Dad? Dad, have you seen Shrek?
KING
No, I haven't, dear. I'm sure he
just went off to look for a nice...
mud hole to cool down in. You know,
after your little spat last night.
FIONA
Oh. You heard that, huh?
KING
The whole kingdom heard you. I mean,
after all, it is in his nature to
be…well, a bit of a brute.
FIONA
28.
Him? You know, you didn't exactly
roll out the Welcome Wagon.
KING
Well, what did you expect? Look at
what he's done to you.
FIONA
Shrek loves me for who I am. I would
think you'd be happy for me.
KING
Darling, I'm just thinking about
what's best for you. Maybe you
should do the same.
13 EXT. FOREST 13
SHREK
(reading the potion)
"Happily Ever After Potion. Maximum
strength. For you and your true
love. If one of you drinks this, you
both will be fine. Happiness,
comfort and beauty divine." You both
will be fine? I guess it means it'll
affect Fiona, too.
DONKEY
Hey, man, this don't feel right. My
donkey senses are tingling all over.
Drop that jug o' voodoo and let's
get out of here.
SHREK
It says, "Beauty Divine." How bad
can it be?
(sniffs the potion and
sneezes)
DONKEY
See, you're allergic to that stuff.
You'll have a reaction. And if you
think that I'll be smearing Vapor
Rub over your chest, think again!
SHREK
Well, here's to us, Fiona.
DONKEY
Shrek? You drink that, there's no
going back.
29.
SHREK
I know.
DONKEY
No more wallowing in the mud?
SHREK
I know.
DONKEY
No more itchy butt crack?
SHREK
I know!
DONKEY
But you love being an ogre!
SHREK
I know! But I love Fiona more.
DONKEY
Shrek, no! Wait!
SHREK drinks the potion. There’s a long pause then he farts.
DONKEY
I think you grabbed the "Farty Ever
After" potion.
PUSS
Maybe it's a dud.
SHREK
Or maybe Fiona and I were never
meant to be.
Thunder cracks and he passes out
DONKEY
Shrek!
Black out.
FADE IN:
FIONA enters with her luggage.
KING
There you are! We missed you at
dinner. What is it, darling?
FIONA
30.
Dad...I've been thinking about what
you said. And I'm going to set
things right.
KING
Ah! Excellent! That's my girl.
FIONA
It was a mistake to bring Shrek
here. I'm going to go out and find
him. And then we'll go back to the
swamp where we belong.
QUEEN
Fiona, please! Let's not be rash,
darling. You can't go anywhere right
now.
Thunder cracks again and FIONA collapses.
KING
Fiona!
14 INT. IN THE BARN - MORNING 14
SISTER
Good morning, sleepyhead. I love
your kitty!
SHREK
Oh... My head...
SISTER
Here, I fetched a pail of water.
SHREK
Thanks. Uhh!
(sees his reflection in
the pale)
Aahh! A cute button nose? Thick,
wavy locks? Taut, round buttocks?
I'm... I'm...
SISTER
Gorgeous!
(moves in closer)
I'm Jill. What's your name?
SHREK
Um... Shrek.
SISTER
Shrek? Wow. Are you from Europe?
31.
SHREK looks around confused.
SISTER
You're tense. I want to rub your
shoulders.
SHREK
Have you seen my donkey?
DONKEY enters and begins studying SHREK, followed by PUSS.
DONKEY
Wow! That's some quality potion,
Shrek! What's in that stuff?
PUSS
"Warning: Side effects may include
burning, itching, oozing, weeping.
Not intended for heart patients or
those with... nervous disorders."
SHREK
What?
PUSS
Señor? "To make the effects of this
potion permanent, the drinker must
obtain his true love's kiss by
midnight."
SHREK
Midnight?
DONKEY
Why is it always midnight?
SISTER
Pick me! I'll be your true love!
SHREK
Look, lady, I already have a true
love.
SISTER
Oh...
PUSS
Take it from me, Boss. You are going
to have one satisfied Princess.
DONKEY
And let's face it. Even though you
are a lot easier on the eyes, inside
you're the same old mean, salty...
32.
SHREK
(simultaneously)
Easy.
DONKEY
...cantankerous, foul, angry ogre
you always been.
SHREK
And you're still the same annoying
donkey.
DONKEY
(Bashful)
Yeah.
SHREK
Well...Look out, Princess. Here
comes the new me.
DONKEY
First things first. We need to get
you out of those clothes.
SISTER gasps.
15 EXT. THE CASTLE GATE 15
GUARD
Halt!
SHREK
Tell Princess Fiona her husband, Sir
Shrek, is here to see her.
FIONA wakes up as a human and looks at herself in the mirror.
She screams.
SHREK
Fiona!
FIONA
Shrek?
SHREK runs into FIONA’s room as FIONA runs down to the castle
gates. FG enters the room just before SHREK, she is cloaked.
SHREK
Fiona?
FG
Hello, handsome.
33.
FIONA
Shrek!
DONKEY
Princess!
FIONA
Donkey?
DONKEY
Wow! That potion worked on you, too?
FIONA
What potion?
DONKEY
Shrek took some magic potion. And
well...Now, he’s sexy!
FIONA
(looking at PUSS)
Shrek?
PUSS
For you, baby... I could be.
DONKEY
Yeah, you wish.
FIONA
Donkey, where is Shrek?
DONKEY
He went inside looking for you.
DONKEY and PUSS exit.
FIONA
Shrek?
SHREK
Fiona! Fiona!
FG
(blocks his exit with her
wand)
Are you going so soon? Don't you
want to see your wife?
CHARMING enters.
CHARMING
Fiona?
34.
FIONA
Shrek?
CHARMING
Aye, Fiona. It is me. What happened
to your voice?
SHREK
The potion changed a lot of things,
Fiona. But not the way I feel about
you.
KING and QUEEN enter.
QUEEN
Fiona?
KING
Charming?
CHARMING
(showing off outfit)
Do you think so?
(laughs)
Dad. I was so hoping you'd approve.
QUEEN
Um... Who are you?
KING
Mom, it's me, Shrek. I know you
never get a second chance at a first
impression, but, well, what do you
think?
(Hugs FIONA)
SHREK
Fiona! Fiona!
FG
Fiona, Fiona! Ho-ho-ho! Oh, shoot! I
don't think they can hear us,
pigeon.
(sighs deeply)
Don't you think you've already
messed her life up enough?
SHREK
I just wanted her to be happy.
FG
And now she can be. Oh, sweetheart.
She's finally found the prince of
her dreams.
35.
SHREK
But look at me. Look what I've done
for her.
FG
It's time you stop living in a fairy
tale, Shrek. She's a princess, and
you're an ogre. That's something no
amount of potion will ever change.
SHREK
But...I love her.
FG
If you really love her... you'll let
her go.
SHREK leaves.
16 INT. THE UGLY STEPSISTER’S TAVERN 16
SISTER
Here you go, boys.
PUSS
Just leave the bottle, Doris.
SISTER
Hey. Why the long face?
SHREK
It was all just a stupid mistake. I
never should have rescued her from
that tower in the first place.
PUSS
I hate Mondays.
DONKEY
I can't believe you'd walk away from
the best thing that happened to you.
SHREK
What choice do I have? She loves
that pretty boy, Prince Charming.
DONKEY
Come on. Is he really that goodlooking?
SISTER
Are you kidding? He's gorgeous! He
has a face that looks like it was
36.
carved by angels.
PUSS
Oh. He sounds dreamy.
SHREK
You know...shockingly, this isn't
making me feel any better. Look,
guys. It's for the best. Mom and Dad
approve, and Fiona gets the man
she's always dreamed of. Everybody
wins.
DONKEY
Except for you. I don't get it,
Shrek. You love Fiona.
SHREK
Aye. And that's why I have to let
her go.
KING enters in a cloak, at the back of the tavern.
KING
Excuse me, is she here?
GUARD
She's, uh... in the back.
KING
Oh, hello again. Fairy Godmother.
Charming.
FG
You'd better have a good reason for
dragging us down here, Harold.
KING
Well, I'm afraid Fiona isn't
really... warming up to Prince
Charming.
CHARMING
FYI, not my fault.
FG
No, of course it's not, dear.
CHARMING
I mean, how charming can I be when I
have to pretend I'm that dreadful
ogre?
KING
37.
No, no, it's nobody's fault. Perhaps
it's best if we just call the whole
thing off, okay?
FG AND CHARMING
What?
KING
You can't force someone to fall in
love!
FG
I beg to differ. I do it all the
time!
(pulls out a magical
potion from her bag)
Have Fiona drink this and she'll
fall in love with the first man she
kisses, which will be Charming.
KING
Umm... no.
FG
What did you say?
KING
I can't. I won't do it.
FG
Oh, yes, you will. If you remember,
I helped you with your happily ever
after. And I can take it away just
as easily. Is that what you want? Is
it?
KING
No.
FG
Good boy. Now, we have to go. I need
to do Charming's hair before the
ball. He's hopeless. He's all high
in the front. He can never get to
the back. You need someone to do the
back.
CHARMING
Oh. Thank you, Mother.
DONKEY
Mother?
FG
38.
The ogre! Stop them! Stop them!
The guards grab SHREK, DONKEY and PUSS and all exit.
17 INT. THE CASTLE 17
The KING enters with a pair of tea cups. He pours the poison
into one of them, just before FIONA enters.
KING
Darling? Ah. I thought I might find
you here. How about a nice hot cup
of tea before the ball?
FIONA
I'm not going.
KING
The whole Kingdom's turned out to
celebrate your marriage.
FIONA
There's just one problem. That's not
my husband. I mean, look at him.
KING
Yes, he is a bit different, but
people change for the ones they
love. You'd be surprised how much I
changed for your mother.
FIONA
Change? He's completely lost his
mind!
KING
Why not come down to the ball and
give him another chance? You might
find you like this new Shrek.
FIONA
But it's the old one I fell in love
with, Dad. I'd give anything to have
him back.
(reached for one of the
tea cups)
KING
Darling. That's mine. Decaf.
Otherwise I'm up all night.
FIONA
39.
(drinking from the other
cup)
Thanks.
18 INT. THE DUNGEON 18
DONKEY
I got to get out of here! I got to
get out of here! You can't lock us
up like this! Let me go! What about
my Miranda rights? You're supposed
to say I have the right to remain
silent. Nobody said I have the right
to remain silent!
SHREK
You HAVE the right to remain silent.
What you lack is capacity.
PUSS
I must hold on before I, too, go
totally mad.
PINOCHIO
Shrek? Donkey?
PUSS
Too late.
SHREK
Gingy! Pinocchio! Get us out of
here!
GINGY
Quick! Tell a lie!
PINOCHIO
What should I say?
SHREK
Anything, but quick!
GINGY
Say something crazy like, "I'm
wearing LADIES' UNDERWEAR!"
PINOCHIO
I am wearing ladies' underwear.
SHREK
Are you?
PINOCHIO
40.
I most certainly am not!
(his nose grows)
DONKEY
It looks like you most certainly am
are!
PINOCHIO
I am not!
PUSS
What kind?
GINGY
(looking in the back of
PINOCHIO’s LEDERHOSEN)
IT'S A THONG!
PINOCHIO
Oww! They're briefs!
GINGY
Are not.
PINOCHIO
Are too!
GINGY
Here we go. Hang tight.
(picks the lock WITH
PINOCHIO’S NOSE)
SHREK
Okay boys! We've got to stop that
kiss!
DONKEY
I thought you was going to let her
go.
SHREK
I was, but I can't let them do this
to Fiona.
DONKEY
Boom! That's what I like to hear.
Look who's coming around!
PINOCHIO
It's impossible! You'll never get
in. The castle's guarded. There's a
moat and everything!
(nose shrinks back down)
41.
GINGY
Folks, it looks like we're up
chocolate creek without a Popsicle
stick.
SHREK
Don’t worry guys, I have a plan. To
the castle!
19 INT. THE ROYAL BALL 19
ROYAL MESSENGER
Ladies and gentlemen. Presenting
Princess Fiona and her new husband,
Prince Shrek.
AUDIENCE applauses, cheering. CHARMING begins waving and
encouraging the audience.
FIONA
Shrek, what are you doing?
CHARMING
I'm just playing the part, Fiona.
FIONA
Is that glitter on your lips?
CHARMING
Mm. Cherry flavored. Want to taste?
FIONA
Ugh! What is with you?
CHARMING
But, Muffin Cake...
FIONA gets fed up and turns to leave, CHARMING looks at FG
for help.
FG
(Sotto Voce)
Play something! Now!
(turns to the AUDIENCE)
Ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to
dedicate this song to... Princess
Fiona and Prince Shrek.
CHARMING
Fiona, my Princess. Will you honor
me with a dance?
AUDIENCE
42.
Dance! Dance!
FIONA
Since when do you dance?
CHARMING
Fiona, my dearest, if there's one
thing I know, it's that love is full
of surprises.
OUTSIDE THE BALL
All right, fellas! Let's crash this
party!
GUARD
Halt right there!
GINGY
Make me!
GUARD grabs GINGY by the collar.
GINGY
Not the gumdrop button!
DONKEY and PUSS grab the GUARD.
DONKEY
Go! Go! Your lady needs you! Go!
SHREK exits.
PUSS
Today, I repay my debt.
GUARD yells and is chased offstage by PUSS. DONKEY, PINOCHIO
and GINGY FOLLOW.
SHREK
Stop! Hey, you! Back away from my
wife.
FIONA
Shrek?
FG
You couldn't just go back to your
swamp and leave well enough alone.
SHREK
Pinocchio! Get the wand!
PINOCHIO runs for the wand but gets zapped along the way. His
‘PINOCHIO’ nose is gone.
43.
PINOCHIO
I'm a real boy!
The WOLF barges in and blows the wand out of FG’s hand, GINGY
picks it up and accidentally zaps PINOCHIO, his wooden nose
appears again.
PINOCHIO
I'm a real boy. Aah! Oh.
FG
That's mine!
PUSS and DONKEY enter.
DONKEY
Pray for mercy, from Puss...
PUSS
and Donkey!
FG
She's taken the potion! Kiss her
now!
CHARMING kisses FIONA.
SHREK
No!
CHARMING and FIONA look at eachother longingly, SHREK is
heartbroken.
FIONA
(headbutting CHARMING)
Hya!
ALL gasp.
SHREK
Fiona.
FIONA
Shrek.
SHREK and FIONA embrace.
FG
Harold! You were supposed to give
her the potion!
KING
Well, I guess I gave her the wrong
tea.
44.
CHARMING
(snatching the wand and
tossing it back to FG)
Mommy!
FIONA
Mommy?
FG
I told you. Ogres don't live happily
ever after.
FG tries to zap SHREK but KING grabs the wand. They both
disappear.
FIONA
Oh, Dad!
(sobbing)
PINOCHIO
Is he...?
GINGY
Yup. He croaked.
Croak sound can be heard. FIONA picks up a frog.
QUEEN
Harold?
FIONA
Dad?
KING
I'd hoped you'd never see me like
this.
DONKEY
And he gave you a hard time!
SHREK
Donkey!
KING
No, no, he's right. I'm sorry. To
both of you. I only wanted what was
best for Fiona. But I can see now...
she already has it. Shrek, Fiona...
Will you accept an old frog's
apologies... and my blessing?
QUEEN
Harold?
45.
KING
I'm sorry, Lillian. I just wish I
could be the man you deserve.
UEEN
You're more that man today than you
ever were... warts and all.
Clock chimes.
PUSS
Boss! The Happily Ever After Potion!
SHREK
Midnight! Fiona. Is this what you
want? To be this way forever?
FIONA
What?
SHREK
Because if you kiss me now... we can
stay like this.
FIONA
You'd do that? For me?
SHREK
Yes.
FIONA
I want what any princess wants. To
live happily ever after,
(SHREK leans in to kiss
her but she stops him)
with the ogre I married.
PUSS
Whatever happens, I must not cry!
You cannot make me cry!
(sobs)
Clock chimes. Flashing lights, as the crowd gathers round and
reveals the ogre SHREK and FIONA.
SHREK
Now, where were we? Oh. I remember.
FADE OUT:
Spotlight on DONKEY.
DONKEY
46.
Hey! Isn't we supposed to be having
a fiesta?
FANFARE
THE END.
